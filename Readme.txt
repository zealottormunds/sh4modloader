Thanks for downloading!

This mod is for the GOG version of Silent Hill 4.
F1 key opens the mod menu. Open it only while you're ingame, not during menus or cutscenes, otherwise there's a chance the game will softlock. I've included two presets for the camera, but you can customize it any way you want.

Changelog v1.0:
- OTS Camera Mod
- First Person Camera Mod
- FPS Uncap Mod (Experimental, extremely buggy)
- Hide HUD Mod

Any errors, crashes or softlocks you find, let me know. And expect some updates later, along with the source code.
