Thanks for downloading!

This mod is for the GOG version of Silent Hill 4.
F1 key opens the mod menu. Open it only while you're ingame, not during menus or cutscenes, otherwise there's a chance the game will softlock. I've included two presets for the camera, but you can customize it any way you want.

Any errors, crashes or softlocks you find, let me know. And expect some updates later, along with the source code.

Changelog v1.0:
- OTS Camera Mod
- First Person Camera Mod
- FPS Uncap Mod (Experimental, extremely buggy)
- Hide HUD Mod

Changelog v1.1:
- Increased the camera sensitivity limit to 900
- Fixed setting the fog to "normal" after forcing a preset
- Implemented a very cheap way to change the hotkey for the menu (create a file in "plugins/OTSMod/" named hotkey.txt, and write inside the key you want to use. This change only works if you set it to alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9), always in caps.

Sample content for hotkey.txt:
0
(This will set the hotkey to number 0)
